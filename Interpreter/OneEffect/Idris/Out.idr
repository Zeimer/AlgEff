import Effects

import Control.Monad.Writer

-- Idris has no built-in LOG effect, so we have to make one ourselves.
-- First, we have to know what an Effect is. We can check this using
-- the command :doc Effect or :printdef Effect 
--
-- Effect : Type
-- Effect = (x : Type) -> Type -> (x -> Type) -> Type
--
-- x is the return type of the computation.
--
-- The second type is the input resource, because in Idris effects are tied to
-- resources. For example, the resource tied to the STATE effect is... well,
-- the state itself.
--
-- The third thing, (x -> Type), is a family of types parametrized by x, i.e.
-- if we give it something of type x, it gives us back a type. It represents
-- a computation that is run on the input resource and that gives us back the
-- output resource. For the STATE effect, for example, we could change the type
-- of state we have using the put operation.

data Log : Type -> Effect where
    Tell : a -> Log a () (List a) (\_ => List a)

-- Thus, the declaration
--
-- data Log : Effect
--
-- means in fact
--
-- Log : (x : Type) -> Type -> (x -> Type) -> Type
--
-- We want the resource of our Log effect to be a list of messages, where the
-- messages may be of any type a, not just String. We want the output resource
-- to be the same, so we put here (\_ => List a), a type family that always
-- returns List a.
--
-- We want only one operation, Tell, which takes a message of type a, returns () and
-- has the Log effect, whose input and output resource is List a, the list of messages
-- that we will append to.

LOG : Type -> EFFECT
LOG t = MkEff (List t) (Log t)

-- The Log data type of above has to be promoted to a 'concrete' effect (as the
-- documentation under :doc EFFECT says). Thus in our code we will write our effect
-- as LOG (List a).

tell : a -> Eff () [LOG a]
tell x = call (Tell x)

-- We have to write some boilerplate to promote the Tell operation to Eff,
-- a monad which is an environment in which effects are run.
--
-- Eff () [LOG (List a)] means that our tell function returns () (just as the
-- Tell operation) and has the effect LOG (List a), which is the promoted
-- version of Log.
