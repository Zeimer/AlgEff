-- This time the idea for doing effects is to parametrize our type of values
-- with an arbitrary m of kind * -> * and then constrain it using classes
-- like MonadState and MonadError, and run it using some concrete monad stack.
-- This leads to the somewhat ugly-looking codomain of our functions, namely
-- m (Value m).

-- Our design choice spills to related types: now we have to write Env m
-- instead of just Env, like before, but this isn't too much trouble.

-- Haskell doesn't have a good class for nondeterminism, so we have to make it
-- ourselves. m can be MonadNondet when it's a monad that has two additional
-- operations: fail' and choice. They will fit perfectly for handling Fail and Amb.
--
-- The prime in the name of fail' comes from the fact that there's a function
-- named fail, which is a part of the Monad class, but this is a design mistake
-- on the part of the standard library, because failing need not make sense in
-- an arbitrary monad.
class Monad m => MonadNondet m where
    fail' :: m a
    choice :: m Bool

-- The list monad of course is a natural candidate for the nondeterminism monad.
-- Failure can be represented with an empty list and choice with a two element
-- list, containig True and False. We will however not use this instance, because
-- we will be using ListT and not the plain old [].

-- It would be good if we could just make an instance saying that nondeterministic
-- monads get transformed into nondeterministic monads, but sadly this doesn't work.
-- Even if we turn on the FlexibleInstances and UndecidableInstances languages
-- extensions, we have a problem with overlapping instances. We thus have to write
-- some boilerplate below to get around this. This situation is extremely annoying
-- in the bigger picture, because if we have N monad transformers, we have to write
-- N^2 instances to make everything work as intended.

-- This is how classes work in practice: we constrain m using

--
-- Note that this improves modularity a lot, because we only need to mention
-- one class to make this work. With transformers, we had to to mention the
-- whole transformer stack explicitly (or we could have done it like here, but
-- then we would need to do some heavy lifting).

-- Also note that we need the pragma FlexibleContexts to be able to write
-- MonadError String m, which would be otherwise considered an error, because
-- String is not a type variable.

-- we can use the function modify, which works for any monad which has an
-- instance of MonadState.

-- Combining classes is easy: we just add more constraints. The sad thing is
-- that the more effects we want to use, the longer our list of constraints

-- But we can solve this problem with the pragma ConstraintKinds. Thanks to it we
-- can define a new type alias and use it instead of the long constraint list.
-- This makes our type signatures even shorter than before! However, the problem
-- persists for cases in which we don't use all the effects - we then have to list
-- them manually (or give the shorter, but less precise list of effects using the

-- Interpreting our calculus is so much easier using classes.
-- For Count, we can simply use the operation get :: MonadState s m => m s
-- which returns the current state.
-- For Fail and Amb, we use the operations fail' and choice from our MonadNondet
-- class that we tailored precisely to fir this purpose.
-- For Out, we use tell :: MonadWriter String m => m () which appends a message
-- to the log. Note that our log is now a String instead of [Value m]. We can't
-- use the latter, because our Value type is now parametrized by m, so that if
-- we wanted a log of type [Value m], we would need to construct the infinite
-- type
--
-- Value m ~ StateT Int (WriterT [Value m] (ListT (Either String))) (Value m).

-- This is impossible, as ghc would tell us if we tried to do that. Therefore,
